# Regression-Model-Project

This project focuses on finding out the best variables that define the overall variation in the prediction result. So we took the 
"mtcars" data set of a collection of cars to explore the relationship between a set of variables and MPG (outcome). Main questions were:-

* "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
* "How different is the MPG between automatic manual transmission?"

Various factors were considered initially but in the end it was concluded that 3 variables were able to define the maximum R-Squared error,
which means that maximum variation in the outcome was effected by these 3 variables.
